Barometrum
==========

Barometrum is a simple yet fully functional barometer application designed for mobile phones and tablets. It uses the device's internal pressure sensor to measure and display air pressure and plots the values in a graph.
You can use Barometrum to observe the change in the atmospheric air pressure at your current location. The readings provided will reflect even small changes in the atmospheric air pressure anywhere you are.
Changes in the atmospheric air pressure tends to be very slow changing and subject to weather conditions.
The local altitude can be used for calculating the Mean sea level pressure (MSLP). The MSLP mode can be enabled on the Settings menu and in contrast to the absolute mode, it provides readings in the standardized format used for weather forecast.
